# CheckersGame

Made as a final project for a Intro to Computer Science class. It allows for up to two players to play Checkers according the international rules. It also includes a # visual component so that the players can actively see their moves and current status of the board. Ultiamtely, a winner is declared when either all the opponents pieces are captured or a player cannot make any more possible moves.
